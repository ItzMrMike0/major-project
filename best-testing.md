# Best Testing
## Non-programmer's notes
### Positives
- The art is good 
- The enemy AI is interesting and well made
- If you are outside an opponent's attack range they can't hit you
- Good map design some areas you can't traverse, stat buffs and other stuff
- Wide range of animations 

### Negatives
- The music is quite loud, if there was a settings tab it would be better
- Wish there was more diversity in attack options, block, backstep etc 
- Wish there was a tutorial 
- The advantage and disadvantage are hard to understand 

## Programmer's notes
### Positives
- Game is very well designed
- Sound effects are rich and varied 
- Nice that you can see the enemy attack range by clicking on them
- The animations are elaborate and well timed
- The variable UI placement is helpful, and well made
- The stat boosts on certain tiles are a nice touch

### Negatives
- Would be nice if the UI elements matched the pixel art style
- The keyboard controls do not make sense to someone who has not played this type of game before
- Character placement on top of complex tiles looks odd at times
- An instructions or start screen would be a nice addition
