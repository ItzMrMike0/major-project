## Non-programmer's notes
- Woohoo.

## Programmer's notes
### Positives
- Game is very well designed
- Sound effects are rich and varied 
- Nice that you can see the enemy attack range by clicking on them
- The animations are elaborate and well timed
- The variable UI placement is helpful, and well made
- The stat boosts on certain tiles are a nice touch

### Negatives
- Would be nice if the UI elements matched the pixel art style
- The keyboard controls do not make sense to someone who has not played this type of game before
- Small visual glitch where players disappear while moving 
- Character placement on top of complex tiles looks odd at times
- An instructions or start screen would be a nice addition
