# Project Proposal: Fire Emblem 
A Fire Emblem clone which is a tactical RPG game featuring strategic, grid-based gameplay that allows players to move characters across a map, engage in turn-based combat, and make strategic decisions on both offense and defense. 

The game will include a variety of character classes with distinct abilities, a dynamic battle system where positioning, terrain, and stats play key roles, and a campaign that challenges the player's ability to adapt to different tactical situations. 

Players will control a group of heroes, each with unique skills and strengths, and face off against enemies with AI tactics. 

Winning will rely not only on combat prowess but also on strategic planning and managing resources.
